Photon-Beetle: Lightweight Authenticated Encryption &amp; Hashing 

## Overview

Photon-Beetle is the fifth NIST Light Weight Cryptography (LWC) competition's final round candidate, which I've decided to implement as a zero-dependency, easy to use, header-only C++ library. Using this library in your project should be as easy as just including proper header files ( see [below](#usage) for example ) & letting compiler know where to find these headers. Before this, I've worked on following implementations which are also competing in NIST LWC

- Ascon, see [here](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/ascon)
- TinyJambu, see [here](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/tinyjambu)
- Xoodyak, see [here](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/xoodyak)
- Sparkle, see [here](https://github.com/itzmeanjan/sparkle)

Here I'm maintaining recommended versions ( well parameters suggested in the specification document ) of both Photon-Beetle-Hash & Photon-Beetle-AEAD.

Photon-Beetle-Hash[32] | Photon-Beetle-AEAD[32, 128]
:-- | --:
Given N ( >= 0) -bytes input message, this algorithm computes 32 -bytes digest | Given 16 -bytes secret key, 16 -bytes public message nonce, N ( >=0 ) -bytes associated data & M ( >=0 ) -bytes plain text, encryption algorithm computes M ( >=0 ) -bytes cipher text & 16 -bytes authentication tag. After that using decryption algorithm, cipher text can be deciphered back to plain text along with a boolean verification flag. AEAD scheme provides secrecy only for plain text but authenticity, integrity for both plain(/cipher) text & associated data. In case of failure in tag verification, unverified plain text is never released - it's zeroed.
--- 

> **Note** Associated data is never encrypted by this AEAD scheme.

> **Note** There are two recommended versions of Photon-Beetle-AEAD, which are only different in their RATE length i.e. how many bytes are consumed in every iteration. Rate can be either 4 -bytes or 16 -bytes. And as expected, Photon-Beetle-AEAD[128], which uses 16 -bytes rate, it much faster ( to encrypt/ decrypt ) compared to Photon-Beetle-AEAD[32] âˆ€ messages of length >= 64B. Also note, Photon-Beetle-Hash has only one recommended variant, which consumes 32 -bits of input message in every iteration ( absorption phase ).

> **Note** For understanding what's AEAD, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption)

> **Note** For checking progress of NIST LWC standardization effort, see [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/finalists)

During this work, I followed Photon-Beetle specification, which was submitted to NIST LWC competition's final round call, see [this](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/finalist-round/updated-spec-doc/photon-beetle-spec-final.pdf). I suggest you go through that specification to get better understanding of Photon-Beetle-{Hash, AEAD}.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler such as `g++`/ `clang++`, with C++20 standard library

```fish
$ g++ --version
g++ (Homebrew GCC 12.2.0) 12.2.0

$ clang++ --version
Apple clang version 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin22.2.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

- System development utilities like `make`, `cmake` and `git` is required. While `python3`, `unzip` and `wget` is also required for testing.

```fish
$ make --version
GNU Make 3.81

$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.23.2

$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.9

$ git --version
git version 2.39.1

$ unzip -v
UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Info-ZIP.

$ wget --version
GNU Wget 1.21.3 built on darwin22.1.0.
```

- Install `python3` dependencies by issuing

```fish
python3 -m pip install -r wrapper/python/requirements.txt --user
```

- For benchmarking implementation on CPU systems, you'll need to have `google-benchmark` library globally installed; see [here](https://github.com/google/benchmark/tree/60b16f1#installation) for guidance.

## Testing

For checking functional correctness & conformance with Photon-Beetle specification, I use test vectors submitted with NIST LWC submission package.

- For testing Photon-Beetle-Hash, I use same input bytes as provided in Known Answer Tests ( KATs ) & match computed digest(s) against provided ones.
- While for Photon-Beetle-AEAD, I'm using given secret key, nonce, associated data & plain text ( in KATs ) and computing cipher text, authentication tag. After that I also attempt to decrypt cipher text back to plain text while checking for truth value in verification flag. Finally to ensure conformance, I make sure to check both computed cipher text and authentication tag with given ones in test vectors.

For executing tests, issue

```fish
make
```

## Benchmarking

For benchmarking Photon-Beetle-{Hash, AEAD} on CPU based systems, issue

> **Warning** If your CPU has scaling enabled, you may want to disable that, see [this](https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/60b16f1/docs/user_guide.md#disabling-cpu-frequency-scaling) guide.

```fish

## Usage

Using Photon-Beetle C++ API is as easy as including proper header files & letting compiler know where it can find these header files, which is `./include` directory.

If you're only interested in Photon-Beetle-Hash implementation, consider importing [`include/hash.hpp`](./include/hash.hpp) in your project, while for Photon-Beetle-AEAD include [`include/aead.hpp`](./include/aead.hpp). Or you may just include [`./include/photon_beetle.hpp`](./include/photon_beetle.hpp) which has both hashing and aead headers included.

> **Note** Photon-Beetle-Hash produces 32 -bytes digest, given N -bytes input message | N >= 0.

You may note, Photon-Beetle-AEAD routines i.e. encrypt/ decrypt take a template parameter called **RATE**, which can âˆˆ {4, 16}. If you want to use Photon-Beetle-AEAD-32 variant, which consumes 4 -bytes of message/ associated data in every iteration, ensure that you set **RATE = 4**. When interested in using Photon-Beetle-AEAD-128, set **RATE = 16**, so that permutation state can consume 16 -bytes of message/ associated data per iteration.

> **Note** For both Photon-Beetle-AEAD-32 & Photon-Beetle-AEAD-128, secret key/ public message nonce/ authentication tag is of byte length 16.

I've written two examples demonstrating usage of Photon-Beetle-{Hash, AEAD} API.

- For Photon-Beetle-AEAD-{32,128}, see [here](./example/aead.cpp)
